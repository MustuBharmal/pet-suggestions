Welcome to the Dog Matcher Quiz App! This Flutter app helps users find dog breeds that match their preferences and habits through a multi-step questionnaire.

## Getting Started

This application contains multiple directories. Let's begin with screen directory. 
Dog Matcher Quiz App contains 3 screens in total. Welcome screen, Quiz screen and Suggestion screen,
Then comes the models directory. In the models directory there are 2 files who store model dog and other is questionnaire.
Third and last is provider and constant respectively. Providers are use to pass data throughout the app conveniently. Also they are used in case we have to fetch data from database.
Constants directory have contents of any type like colors, font weight, custom theme etc.

And the last is report directory. It contains brief report regarding the app and it's functionality.
Also it is added with the e-mail I sent to greencircle.challenge@gmail.com.
